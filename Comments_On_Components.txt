Comments and Remarks on Components and their Ordering:

R1, R2, R3 and R4:

These 10-kOhm-resistors are so-called "Pullup-Resistors" for the I²C Bus.
There is no need to buy exactly the brand and type of resistor that is mentioned in the bill of materials.
The exact value of the resistor, its tolerance or temperature coefficient, neither one of these parameters is critical.
In practice, you can solder-in any old resistor in a 0805-SMD-package with a value between 4,7 kOhms (maybe even less) and 15 kOhms (maybe even more) and the CO2-sensor will work as expected.

C1:

Any ceramic capacitor in a 0805-SMD-package with a value between 10nF (maybe even less) and 1µF (maybe even more) will work here.

D1:

The diode LL4148 is manufactured by many many companies. Any brand will work. In fact, almost any silicon diode will work here as long as you are able to solder it into the board. Just mind the orientation! The mark on diode usually depicts the cathode. If you are unsure, use a Multimeter to check the polarity before soldering!

J1:

The Arduino header kit is also available from many more vendors.
Just search for "Arduino stackable header kit" or "Arduino header kit R3" or "Arduino UNO header kit" in order to find a source of supply.


U1:

The SCD30 from Sensorion is a fast and accurate CO2 sensor, but it has its price.
It is usually available from Digikey, Mouser, Arrow, Glyn, RS-Components, Farnell and other distributors.
Due to the high demand, delivery times can sometimes be longer.
Therefore, before ordering, check whether the sensor is available from stock!

U2:

You can buy the Arduino UNO R3 from the offical store (https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3) or from electronics distributors and dealers.
You can even buy Arduino UNO clones from vendors like Aliexpress, Banggood and so on at much lower prices than the genuine part.
Decide for yourself if you want to buy the original product or the cloned one.

U10:

There exist many many clones of this board on the market, beginning from less than 2 Euros!
We could not find the "original" manufacturer of the Multi-Function Shield and maybe we will never find out who designed it in the first place.
We use the HIMALAYA brand Multi-Function Shield, which seems to have a slightly better quality than the really cheap ones.
But that doesn't mean that the very cheap products don't work. So far, everyone has worked for us

U3:

The TCA9517 is a I²C level converter. The Arduino UNO works on 5V but the maximum voltage level that is allowed on the I²C Pins of the SCD30 is 3.0V. The different voltage levels require the use of a so-called level converter.
The TCA9517DR is available from distributors like Digikey, Mouser and so on and maybe even from ebay.
There exist similar products from other manufacturers (e.g., PCA9517D from NXP) which may work also, but we haven't tried them out yet.


Happy Soldering!
