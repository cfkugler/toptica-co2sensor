# Introduction
We offer you a guide for making your own carbon-dioxide sensor unit to measure the percentage of carbon dioxide gas.
Furthermore TOPTICA gives you the [necessary circuit board](https://www.toptica.com/index.php?id=564) for it â€“ for free!
Now You only need to buy the sensor and the Arduino. With the help of the manual, a soldering iron and some skill you can now build your own CO2 sensor.
Please note: The offer for the free circuit board is limited to one board per household and valid until our stock lasts. Distribution only to private households, not for resale, no warranty.

We wish you good luck with your work and are happy to receive a picture of your finished sensor with the permission to display it on our website [www.toptica.com](http://www.toptica.com/) and our social media platforms Facebook, twitter and LinkedIn.

# Hardware installation guide
For detailed assembly instructions please refere to [``AssemblyManual.PDF``](AssemblyManual.PDF)

# Software installation guide

* Download and install the latest Arduino IDE from the [Arduino Homepage](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). You can find more detailed information on the installation process in the official Arduino [Getting Started Guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide).

* Open the file [``toptica-co2sensor.ino``](./toptica-co2sensor.ino) with the Arduino IDE (double-click on the file)

* To add and use the 3rd party libraries located under ``3rdParty``, click on "Sketch" &rarr; "Include Library" &rarr; "Add .ZIP Library ...". Select the file [``MultiFuncShield-Library.zip``](./3rdParty/MultiFuncShield-Library.zip) and click okay.

* Repeate this process for the file [``SparkFun_SCD30_Arduino_Library-master.zip``](./3rdParty/SparkFun_SCD30_Arduino_Library-master.zip).
